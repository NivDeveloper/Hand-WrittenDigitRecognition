# Hand-WrittenDigitRecognition

## Files

  **ClassifierMLP.py** - this file contains the multi layer perceptron with simlple linear neurons.
  to run this file simply type `python3 ClassifierMLP.py`
  this file will then train the neural network and then request that the user input a file path to a `.jpg` file of a hand written image.

   **ClassifierCNN.py** - this file contains the implememtation fo Concolitional neural network and can again be run using `python3 ClassifierCNN.py`. this will then train the CNN and ask the user to enter a path to a `.jpg` file of a hand written image.
